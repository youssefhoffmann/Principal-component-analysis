# Principal-component-analysis
Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables (entities each of which takes on various numerical values) into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. This transformation is defined in such a way that the first principal component has the largest possible variance (that is, accounts for as much of the variability in the data as possible), and each succeeding component in turn has the highest variance possible under the constraint that it is orthogonal to the preceding components.In this code ,I will try to test PCA on crime data by finding eigenvalues ,maintaining those prominent,calculating the quality of projection of individuals,visualizing this projection on prominent axis, then calculating the contribution of individuals on principal axis and finally,calculating the correlation between individuals and components.
